    <h3>
      INTRODUCTION TO THE DIVINATION BY TEA-LEAVES
    </h3>
    <p>
      At no time in the history of the world has there been such
      earnest searching for light and knowledge in all matters
      relating to Psychic Phenomena as in the present day. The
      desire to investigate some new disclosure has resulted in yet
      other discoveries. Such will be handed on in their various
      forms to be studied and used by those who seek to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few subjects need more patience than those dealing with
      Psychology. Even those who put their knowledge to a practical
      use in such studies as divination by tea-leaves, must still
      plod patiently along a path thickly strewn with new
      knowledge. The powers of clairvoyance, for instance, cannot
      be forced or hurried; such arbitrary laws as time have no
      meaning for the subconscious self, therefore the need for
      hurry does not exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was once told by a very mediumistic woman that she had sat
      in the same room at the same time for an hour every day for
      seven years, because she "wished to develop Clairvoyance."
      Here was patience indeed! In some manifestations of the
      clairvoyant powers within us, it is spontaneous, the closing
      of the eyes to shut out all material surroundings being all
      that is necessary to bring a vision of what is happening, or
      shortly to happen, possibly hundreds of miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all dreams the clairvoyant powers are spontaneous; but for
      the development of clairvoyance at will, great perseverance
      is necessary. Its interests and powers are unlimited, so that
      it is well worth the patience and time spent upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the use of tea-leaves as a means of divination, the more
      developed the "clear sight," the more interesting and
      accurate will be the interpretation. Practice is most
      necessary, especially for those who have less natural
      clairvoyance than others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The desire for knowledge on all Psychic matters has led to an
      increased demand for various methods of bringing into symbols
      and pictures that hidden knowledge of the present and the
      future. That this knowledge can be translated to us
      symbolically is apparent to everyone&mdash;who could doubt
      it, and still believe in anything at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea-leaves are habitually used by many people as a means of
      divination. To some it is an easier method than the cards,
      there is less to memorise, or the crystal.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is in Paris a famous clairvoyant who always uses
      tea-leaves as the medium for her powers of divination. Some
      are inclined to jeer at the fortune in the teacup, but if the
      language of symbolism is rightly understood, the medium
      through which it is seen matters little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea-leaves have the advantage of being simple, inexpensive,
      and within the reach of everyone. It cannot be claimed that
      the cult is of the greatest antiquity; for although it seems
      to have been used in China from very early times, tea was not
      brought into Europe until about the middle of the sixteenth
      century. For many years after its introduction into this
      country, tea was far too costly to be used except by a
      comparatively small proportion of the population. It has,
      however, proved its extreme usefulness as a means of
      divination, as well as its merits as a beverage, for close
      upon three centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a very favourite method with the Highlanders, where it
      is customary for the "guid wife" to read in her cup of tea at
      breakfast the events she may look for during the day. Simple
      though they may probably be, there are to be seen in the
      tea-leaves, a letter, a parcel, a visitor, a wedding, and so
      on. It is said that no Highland seer would take money for
      making prognostications as to the future. This, no doubt, is
      one good reason for their powers as clairvoyants.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a misfortune that clairvoyance should ever have to come
      into the material necessities of money transactions, as it
      tends to mar the clear vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said by some that tea-leaves can foretell the events
      for twenty-four hours only. As clairvoyance has no
      restrictions as to time or space, I cannot see how it can be
      thus laid down as a fact that it is limited to man-made laws
      of time! Certainly there is much evidence of the "tea leaves"
      being capable of foreseeing events of an important nature at
      a considerable distance ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most difficult points in interpreting visions of
      clairvoyance is the time element; simply because time, as we
      know it, does not exist. The intuitive faculty is needed for
      any accurate definition of time, so important to us in our
      present conditions, so absolutely unimportant to the
      subconscious self. Let us decide at once, then, that
      divination by tea-leaves may, and often does, extend to a
      further vision than that of the twenty-four hours. Much
      depends upon the methods used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our individual past, quite apart from the arbitrary laws of
      heredity, makes the road of our future. Possibly this may
      account for the curious fact that in dreams the setting is
      often in childhood's surroundings, while the dream itself is
      obviously of the present or the future. This shows how the
      first beginnings of the event which is to come were brought
      about. It is somewhat like unwinding a cotton reel!
    </p>
    <p>
      There are, no doubt, some who look upon the tea-leaves merely
      as a form of amusement, and who entertain their friends in
      that way. Well, it is a harmless amusement, and is often
      useful at a very dull tea party! But for those who take it
      seriously, and regard it as one of the many means of
      divination, it will be treated with the respect due to such
      matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in other forms of divination, so with the reading of the
      tea-cup, a great deal depends on the seer. Those who are
      naturally clairvoyant will read many events and scenes in the
      cup which would be passed over by others not so gifted. Even
      without this "clear sight," however, the tea-leaves may be
      read by anyone who has learned the principles and the
      symbolic meanings given in this book. With a certain amount
      of intuition and imagination, the tea-cups may be most
      successfully used to reveal the future.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      PRACTICE AND METHOD
    </h3>
    <p>
      A wide, shallow cup is the best kind to use for tea-leaf
      divination&mdash;white if possible. A narrow cup adds to the
      seer's difficulties, as the tea-leaves cannot be plainly
      seen. Small cups, too, are objectionable for the same reason,
      and a fluted cup is even worse. A plain, even surface is
      required, with no pattern of any kind, as this has a tendency
      to confuse the symbols. Indian tea and the cheaper mixtures,
      which contain so much dust and twigs are of no use for
      reading a fortune, as they cannot form into pictures and
      symbols that can easily be distinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who desire to have their tea-leaves interpreted should
      leave about a teaspoonful of tea at the bottom of the cup. It
      should then be taken in the left hand, and turned three times
      from left with a quick swing. Then very gently, slowly, and
      with care, turn it upside down over the saucer, leaving it
      there for a minute, so that all the moisture may drain away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some divinators of the tea-leaves insist on a concentration
      of the mind during this turning of the cup, as do many
      cartomantes whilst the cards are being shuffled; others
      prefer the mind to be as far as possible free from any
      definite thought or desire, simply allowing it to dwell on
      such abstract subjects as flowers or the weather. Personally,
      I advocate this for both systems of divination; it enables
      the subconscious mind to assert itself unhindered, whilst the
      normal mind is in abeyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The turning of the cup before inverting it over the saucer is
      equivalent to the shuffling of the cards. It is as a direct
      result of those few seconds turning that the pictures and
      signs are created, the subconscious mind directing the hand
      holding the cup. The following simple ritual is all that is
      necessary to those consulting the tea-leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cup to be read is held by the seer and turned about as
      necessary, so that the symbols may be read without disturbing
      them. This is important, but no disturbance will take place
      if the moisture has been properly drained away. The handle of
      the cup represents the consultant, also the home, or, if the
      consultant be away from home the present abode.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is necessary to have a starting point in the cup for the
      purpose of indicating events approaching near to, or far
      distant from, the person consulting. The leaves near the rim
      denote such things as may be expected to occur quickly; those
      directly beneath the handle indicate present and immediate
      happenings; those on the sides of the cup suggest more
      distant events; whilst those at the bottom deal with the far
      distant future.
    </p>
    <p>
      This method of fixing the time, coupled with intuition,
      renders it possible to give a consultant some idea as to when
      an event may be expected; but if there be no intuitive sense
      of time, it will be found wiser not to be too positive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The turning of the cup and the draining of the moisture
      having been carried out as directed, the tea-leaves will be
      found distributed at the sides and bottom of the cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those who wish to use the saucer as a further means of
      divination, the following suggestions will be useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      There must be a definite point to represent the consultant,
      and for this reason the saucer is usually rejected. There is
      also the objection that it is more difficult to manipulate in
      the turning. Nevertheless, it is found to give excellent
      results, and, if the cup is bare of events, it is useful to
      be able to find information in the saucer.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, then, to determine the position of the
      consultant. Take the centre of the saucer for this purpose.
      The circle round it represents the home, or if the consultant
      is away from home, the present abode, and also events near at
      hand. The more distant circle indicates those things which
      are not to be expected for some time. The outer circle and
      rim suggest events as yet in the misty future.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the saucer is used as an additional means of seeking
      knowledge of coming events, after the symbols in the cup have
      been exhausted, it will often be found that this secondary
      divination confirms or enlarges upon that which has already
      been foretold in the cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moisture and leaves drained from the cup, having remained
      in the saucer, should be turned by the consultant three times
      with the same swirling motion as for the cup, and the
      moisture carefully poured away. The saucer should be held
      inverted for a few seconds, otherwise when it is placed
      upright, the remaining moisture will disturb the tea-leaves.
      The symbols are read in exactly the same way as in the cup,
      the only difference being the positions representing the
      consultant, the home, and the indications of time. These have
      already been explained.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <h3>
      GENERAL THEORIES IN READING THE CUP
    </h3>
    <p>
      At first sight the interior of the cup will show the leaves
      scattered about apparently haphazard and with no arrangement;
      just a jumble of tea-leaves and nothing more. In reality they
      have come to their positions and have taken on the shapes of
      the symbols for which they stand, by the guidance of the
      subconscious mind directing the hand in the turning of the
      cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      The various shapes and the meanings to be attached to them
      will at first be puzzling to beginners. A good deal of
      practice is necessary before the tea-leaf symbols can be
      accurately interpreted at a glance. That, however, will come
      later, and in time it will be as easy as reading a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish to be a proficient reader of the tea-leaves,
      practise constantly this interpretation of the shapes and
      positions of the leaves. Take a cup and follow out the simple
      instructions for the turning and draining of it, and then
      carefully study the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an excellent plan to make a rough copy of the leaves as
      they present themselves to you in each cup, making notes of
      the various meanings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not feel dismayed if, when you begin looking at the
      tea-leaves, you are unable to discover in them anything
      definitely symbolic. It is certain that nothing will be found
      if the seer is feeling nervous! Keep a calm, open mind, and
      do not be in a hurry, for it is under such conditions only
      that a clear reading of the leaves will be possible. In some
      cases the symbols are more easily read than in others. Much
      depends upon the consultant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gift of imagination (by no means to be confused with
      invention) is of the greatest possible importance in
      discerning the symbols which are of such endless shapes and
      variety. The seer has to find in the forms of the tea-leaves
      a resemblance, sometimes it may be but a faint one, to
      natural objects, <i>e.g.</i>, trees, houses, flowers,
      bridges, and so forth. Figures of human beings and animals
      will frequently be seen, as will squares, triangles, circles,
      and also the line of fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      These signs may be large or small, and the importance of them
      must be judged by their relative size and position. Suppose,
      for instance, that a small cross should be at the bottom of
      the cup, the only one to be seen, the seer would predict that
      a trifling vexation or a tiresome little delay must be
      expected; but not for the present, as it is at the bottom of
      the cup. An alphabetical list of symbols is given later on,
      so it is not necessary to define them here. The various
      points of a more general character, however, must be studied
      before it is possible to give an accurate reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will constantly be found that the stems, isolated leaves,
      or small groups of leaves, form a letter of the alphabet,
      sometimes a number. These letters and numbers have meanings
      which must be looked for in connection with other noticeable
      signs. If an initial "M" appears, and near to it a small
      square or oblong leaf, both being near the rim of the cup, it
      would indicate a letter coming speedily from someone whose
      name begins with an "M." If the initial appears near the
      bottom of the cup it shows that the letter will not be coming
      for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there be a clear space at the bottom of the cup devoid of
      tea-leaves, it shows water, and that, in all probability, the
      letter is coming from abroad. If the symbol of the letter
      comes very near to a bird flying, it shows a telegram. If the
      bird is flying towards the consultant (the handle), the
      telegram has been received. The news in it is to be judged by
      other signs in the cup. If flying away from the handle, the
      telegram is sent by the consultant. A single bird flying
      always indicates speedy news.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a cup with various ominous signs, such as a serpent, an
      owl, or many crosses, the news coming is not likely to be
      pleasant. In a cup without bad signs, it can safely be said
      that the news is good.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a general rule large letters indicate places, whilst
      smaller ones give the names of persons. Thus a large letter
      "E" would stand for Edinburgh and a smaller "E" for Edwards,
      for instance. To all rules there comes the occasional
      exception, and this principle holds good with regard to the
      letters in the tea-cup. It is said that these smaller letters
      always point to the first letter of the surname. Usually it
      is so; but I have constantly found from experience that it is
      the first letter of the Christian name, or even a pet name,
      to which the letter refers. It is well to keep this
      possibility in mind, otherwise the seer may give misleading
      information to consultants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes numbers mean the date for an event to be expected,
      a "5" for instance, very near the brim of the cup, or the
      handle (the consultant), means in five days; or five weeks if
      it come on the side, possibly as far off as five months if
      the figure be at the bottom of the cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      As dots around a symbol always indicate money in some form or
      another, according to the character of the symbol, a figure
      beside the dots would signify the amount of money to be
      expected. If the symbol were that of a legacy with the figure
      "90" near, it would show that a little legacy of ninety
      pounds might be anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly defined symbols that stand out separately are of more
      importance than such as are difficult to discern. Clusters of
      shapeless leaves represent clouds marring the effect of an
      otherwise fortunate cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Journeys are shown by lines or dots formed by the dust and
      smaller leaves of the tea. The length and direction of the
      journey may be known by the extent of the line and, roughly
      speaking, the point of the compass to which it leads, the
      handle in this case representing south. If the line of dots
      ascends sharply to the brim of the cup, a journey to a hilly
      country will be taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supposing the consultant to be at home, and the dots form a
      line from the handle all round the cup and back to the
      handle, it signifies a journey for a visit and the return. If
      the line were to stop before reaching the handle again, with
      an appearance of a house where the line ends, a change of
      residence might safely be predicted. A wavy line shows
      indecision as to arrangements. Crosses upon the line indicate
      that there will be vexation or delay in connection with the
      journey. Large flat leaves some distance apart along the line
      stand for important stations to be passed through.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some consultants there seems very little of interest to
      be read in their cup. There are no events, merely
      trivialities. It is therefore difficult to find anything that
      could be considered as "future," when it seems to be just a
      dead level "present," the daily life, nothing more. It is sad
      for those who have such a dull life, but there is usually
      some sign, a small happening such as a parcel, or a visit
      from a friend. These must be made the most of. The pleasure
      of anticipation will add to the realisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A confused looking tea-cup, without any definite symbols,
      just a muddle of tea-leaves, is useless for the purpose of
      divination, beyond giving an indication of the state of the
      consultant's mind, so vague and undecided in its character
      that it obscures everything. Tell such a one the reason for
      the failure of divining, and recommend a more reliable state
      of mind. Then let them try their "fortune" again in a few
      months, when it may be found quite different.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is of course a great mistake to be always "looking in the
      tea-leaves," as some foolish people do twice a day. It is
      sure to lead to contradictions though there is no harm in the
      habit of "looking in the cup" each morning as others do, for
      finding the events likely to happen in the course of the day.
      This is as permissible as the reading of the cards each
      morning for the day's events by those who consider it a
      safeguard, remembering that to be forewarned is to be
      forearmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people use the tea-cup simply for the purpose of asking
      a definite question, such as, "Is the sum of money I am
      expecting coming soon?" When this is the case, the consultant
      should be told before turning the cup in the hand to
      concentrate the thoughts on this one point, as in the case of
      wishing while shuffling the cards for a definite wish. Then
      the seer must look only for the signs that will give the
      answer to the question, ignoring all other points. This is
      necessary for the giving of a satisfactory answer to the
      question asked.

    <h3>
      DIVINATION BY TEA-LEAVES AS AN AMUSEMENT<br>
      AND AS A MORE SERIOUS STUDY
    </h3>
    <p>
      The need for patience cannot be too strongly impressed upon
      those who are beginning to learn the language of tea-leaves.
      Some of the most interesting symbols are very minute, and
      will certainly be missed by the seer who is in a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      When tea-leaf reading is indulged in merely as an amusement
      to while away a few moments after a meal, a hasty glance at
      the cup, or cup and saucer, will suffice. The seer will just
      note the chief features, such as a journey, a letter, a
      parcel, or news of a wedding, and pass on to the next cup.
      But this is far from being a really interesting method of
      divination by tea-leaves, wherein so much knowledge is to be
      found, and so much useful information gained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who closely study this fascinating subject will
      certainly be well rewarded by a deep personal interest, in
      addition to the pleasure they give to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is wonderful how rapidly converts are made to this form of
      divination. Some who in the past have been heard scornfully
      to assert that they "have no belief in tea-leaves," become
      the most regular inquirers. Moreover, these sceptics have
      proved to be very efficient students.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is always a satisfaction in persuading another to one's
      own point of view. The more obstinate the opposition, the
      more glorious the final conquest!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a rare occurrence nowadays to meet with three people in
      the course of a day, and not to find that one at least is
      deeply interested in fortune-telling in some of its various
      forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite recently I had a letter from a girl who has gone on a
      visit to British Columbia, asking me if I would "do the
      cards" for her, as she could not find anyone in her vicinity
      who was particularly good at divination. She went on to say
      that "there is a perfect rage for fortune-telling out here,
      and everyone is keen on it." Another instance of this
      universal popularity was given to me by a friend who had
      recently been to America. She was amazed at the numbers of
      women whom she saw absorbed in the reading of their tea-cups
      each day of the voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The male sex holds aloof and leaves us to "perform these
      follies." Some ascribe it to man's superiority. Or as briefly
      summed up by a delightful member of their sex, who when
      declaiming against the possibility of the future being made
      visible, said, "With all apologies to you, I must say I am
      not so profoundly stupid as to believe in these things; it
      cannot be anything more than rot."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is remarkable how such protests die away when clairvoyant
      evidence, either by cards, tea-leaves, or other means, has
      accurately predicted some event of the distant future that at
      the time appeared absurd and impossible of happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Woman may lawfully claim superiority with regard to her
      intuitive faculty, and thus she is well equipped for
      exercising her divinatory powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who need be dull or bored when the language of symbolism
      remains to be learned? Perhaps I should say, studied; for
      completely learned it can never be, seeing that fresh events
      are constantly occurring in the world, and new symbols appear
      representing each.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are few things more fascinating than personal
      discovery, and those who become students of divination by
      tea-leaves, or cards, may safely be promised a taste of this
      pleasing sensation of achievement. It is limited to the few
      to discover the marvels of radium, or the discomforts of the
      South Pole, but a fragment of their glory is shared by those
      who find new evidence of the far-reaching knowledge of
      symbolism.

    <h3>
      SOME HINTS FOR DIVINERS
    </h3>
    <h3>
      REMARKABLE INSTANCES OF PROPHECY BY THE TEA-LEAVES
    </h3>
    <center>
    <blockquote>
      "For a man's mind is sometimes wont to tell him more<br>
       than seven watchmen that sit above in a high tower."
    </blockquote>
    </center>
    <p>
      To those of an inquiring or doubting turn of mind, there may
      arise the very natural question as to <i>why</i> one shaped
      tea-leaf should mean "a hat" and another "a table." It is
      useless to point out that these objects are perfectly
      represented by the leaves. That is of no practical
      satisfaction. The simple fact that each language has its
      alphabet, its spelling, and its words, which must be learned
      before there can be any reasonable understanding of it, seems
      the best and obvious reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Symbolism is a wide subject with many branches. Who can
      expect to master even its alphabet in a moment? To those who
      cannot accept the symbols in the tea-leaves on the authority
      of past experience, reaching over several centuries, I would
      recommend a careful study of their cups for, say, three
      months. Let them make notes of such signs as appear and
      beside them place their meanings and predictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of this time, compare all that has taken place
      with these notes, and I think there will be no further lack
      of faith in the tea-leaf symbols.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before very many years have passed the language of symbolism
      by cards, tea-leaves, crystal gazing, etc., will probably be
      almost universally understood. The day will undoubtedly come
      when it will be accepted as naturally as the English
      language, and we shall cease to worry ourselves as to the why
      and wherefore of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important that those who are learning the art of
      divination by tea-leaves should realise the necessity for
      consistently attributing the same meanings to the symbols. Do
      not be tempted to change their interpretation for what may
      seem a more probable, or pleasant, prediction for your
      client. It is a fatal mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that you are dealing with conditions and events of
      the future which are outside the limited knowledge of the
      normal mind, whose power of vision is limited to physical
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      A simple instance of what may occur, should you thus change
      the meanings of the symbols, will suffice to show the folly
      of such a practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A consultant comes to have her "fortune read." She is known
      to you personally, and you are aware that she is anxious to
      hear a hopeful report of someone dear to her who is ill. The
      tea-leaf symbols are obstinately unfavourable, and display
      ominous signs of forthcoming sorrow. If you gloss over this
      fact completely, and predict a rapid recovery from the
      illness, what becomes of your client's faith in the power of
      foretelling the future? Certain it is that the symbols would
      be right in their verdict, and you would be wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is usually easier to prophesy smooth things rather than
      unpleasant facts, but to do this in the face of obvious
      contradictions will lead to disaster in foretelling the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Divination by tea-leaves or cards has the candour to be
      frankly disagreeable when necessary. This is one great
      argument in favour of its unerring truthfulness. There is no
      means by which symbols may be coaxed into proclaiming false
      statements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most practised clairvoyant may occasionally make mistakes
      in her reading of the symbols, but no genuine seer should
      ever deliberately give a wrong interpretation of them to
      please her consultant. The business of the diviner is to give
      what she believes to be a correct and unprejudiced
      translation of the symbols before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is sometimes a vexed question as to what extent
      information of a gloomy nature, which may appear in a
      divination, should be given to a client. Some are in favour
      of withholding such matter altogether, whilst others announce
      it frankly without modification. It seems impossible to lay
      down any hard and fast rule. There are so many things to be
      taken into account, and each case should be treated on its
      merits and according to its peculiar circumstances. There are
      some who would fret themselves ill at the least mention of
      coming misfortune, others would be the better prepared to
      meet it by having been warned of its approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      One rule can be safely made for guidance on this point. Do
      not minimise danger when a timely warning may avert an
      accident, or other misfortune, nor should symbols of ill omen
      be exaggerated. As students become proficient, they will find
      many meanings in the tea-leaves in addition to those which
      they learn from this book. Much will depend upon
      circumstances and individual temperaments.
    </p>
    <p>
      These personally discovered meanings should be carefully
      noted and verified with events as they occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is necessary to remember that divination by the tea-cup is
      by no means limited to personal information. Forthcoming
      public events are frequently revealed. This adds largely to
      the interest and usefulness of the divination. It is
      important to point out this to consultants, so that they may
      not be too ready to fix the whole reading of their cups to
      purely personal matters. It will be found that public news is
      usually foretold in the cups of those who seek information of
      the future as a regular practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those who rarely do so, private affairs alone will
      appear, probably without even a forecast of the weather to be
      expected within the next few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a curious fact that the wider knowledge should seem to
      be reserved for those who practise divination constantly, but
      so it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some remarkable instances of the accurate foretelling of
      public events, which have quite recently been brought to my
      notice, may be interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some weeks before the coal strike of 1920 was declared, a
      pickaxe was seen on several occasions in the cups of two
      persons, both of whom read their tea-leaves regularly. This
      symbol, as will be seen in the dictionary which follows,
      stands for "labour trouble and strikes." A spade was also in
      evidence at intervals, a further sign of "trouble and
      unrest." So that it was through no fault of the tea-leaves if
      some of us were not in the superior position of knowing all
      about the strike before it came to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The symbols already mentioned would of course apply equally
      to railway disturbance, and some time before the threat of a
      strike was announced, these symbols appeared again, together
      with an engine, and a signal at the angle of "Danger." This
      seemed ominous. But within a few days the signal was evident
      once more; but on this occasion set at "All Clear." So it was
      easy to decide that the threatened strike would not take
      place. The accuracy of this prediction by means of the
      tea-leaves was shortly afterwards made evident.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, a week before there seemed to be even a hope of a
      settlement of the coal strike, a mining shaft presented
      itself in one of the tea-cups which had previously been
      indicating the strike. This symbol appeared at the top of the
      cup standing out clearly by itself, evidently predicting the
      miners' return to work within a short time. There was no need
      to depend upon information from the newspapers as to the end
      of the strike, for here in the tea-leaves was all necessary
      evidence of the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another very remarkable instance of symbolism was given to me
      by a friend a short time ago. On Monday morning, October
      26th, 1920, the three following symbols appeared in her
      cup:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;A vulture resting on a rock.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;An eagle.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;A monkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening of that day the death of King Alexander of
      Greece was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be seen, on referring to the dictionary, that an
      eagle and a vulture signify "the death of a monarch." The
      monkey who lay at the bottom of the cup, apparently dead, was
      of course the third symbol as having caused the King's death.
      It was particularly gratifying that these signs should have
      appeared in my friend's cup for she is a mathematical genius,
      and rejects every symbol which she cannot recognise at once.
      She was so struck by these signs that she called them to the
      attention of her mother, who also immediately perceived and
      identified them. The only regrettable omission was that the
      cup was not photographed. It would have been valuable
      evidence for the wonders of the tea-leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      This same friend had another interesting experience. The head
      of an Indian appeared in her cup, with other signs pointing
      to news of a personal nature. She was puzzled, for, as far as
      she knew, there was no one in India from whom she would be in
      the least likely to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very shortly afterwards, however, her mother went on a visit
      to London. There she quite unexpectedly met someone who had
      recently come from India, and who had brought back messages
      of remembrance and affection from a girl who my friend had no
      idea was in India at that time. Hence the Indian in her
      tea-cup!
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst on this subject, I am reminded of another occasion
      when India was represented in the tea-leaves. I was looking
      into my tea-cup one day, when I saw most clearly depicted two
      natives creeping stealthily, their attitude making this
      evident. In their hands were what appeared to be knives, and
      they were making towards a figure that was unmistakably that
      of an officer. He was standing upon what looked like a raised
      platform with a barricade round him. He held a revolver in
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am quite aware that some may think this a tall tale for the
      tea-leaves to relate! But fortunately my reading of the cup
      was witnessed by two others, one of them being a man, who,
      although interested in psychic subjects, despises the
      tea-leaves! Without remarking upon what I saw, I suggested
      that he should look at my cup and see what he made of it.
      Without a moment's hesitation he said, "There is an officer
      defending himself against some natives who are about to
      attack him."
    </p>
    <p>
      My readers will appreciate the satisfaction this testimony
      gave me, coming as it did from one who had never before
      looked into a cup. Moreover, that this witness should have
      been one of the male sex added to its value! This prediction
      of danger for someone in India was borne out by facts that
      were disclosed shortly afterwards. These instances which I
      have given illustrate the variety and interest which are to
      be found in divination by tea-leaves.

    <h3>
      WRITING IN THE TEA-LEAVES
    </h3>
    <h4>
      SOME FREQUENT SYMBOLS
    </h4>
    <p>
      Another source through which messages are received by the
      tea-leaves will be found in the writing which will be seen
      from time to time. Moreover, it has the great advantage of
      being clear and easy to decipher, so that there may be no
      doubt of what is intended to be understood by it. The
      tea-leaves can never be accused of being illegible.
      Occasionally it is very minute writing, and would probably be
      passed over by those who read their cups in a superficial
      manner. To those who study them carefully the future is
      revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one would reasonably expect to find a speech from the
      Prime Minister or an invitation to a tea-party written for
      them in the tea-leaves. But words they certainly will find.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short time ago I saw in my cup, in perfect copperplate
      writing, the word "wait." I was annoyed by it, for what is
      more annoying than having to wait? Sometimes it may happen
      that the tea-leaves&mdash;as with their relatives, the
      tumbler and automatic writing&mdash;become a little shaky in
      their spelling. But this is not a serious defect, and the
      trifling errors do not prevent the word from being
      translatable. It is a recognised fact that writing seen
      through a medium, whether it be tea-leaves, or a dream, is of
      importance, and should always be regarded with attention and
      with an endeavour to understand its message.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should like to point out that certain figures and symbols
      are of so frequent occurrence that it may be well to
      emphasise their general significance by referring to them
      here, in addition to their meaning being given in the
      dictionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those which threaten misfortune, or sorrow, are the
      following: Crosses, snakes, spades, pistols, guns, toads,
      cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joy and success are indicated by such symbols as a crescent
      moon, clover leaves, flowers, trees, anchors, fruit, circles,
      stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having learned the symbols and the combined symbols by heart,
      it will require only a little practice to interpret their
      meanings without hesitation. For those who find difficulty in
      committing the dictionary to memory, an essential for
      proficient reading of the cup, I would suggest that they
      write down any meaning which may seem specially hard to
      remember, roughly drawing its symbol beside it. In this way
      the difficulty will soon be overcome.

      THE "NELROS" CUP

      TWO EXAMPLE READINGS OF ITS SIGNS

    <p>
      Some readers may find an additional interest in divination by
      tea-leaves, if they use a cup marked with the planetary
      symbols, patented as the "Nelros Cup of Fortune." A short
      explanation of the symbols, and the method of using this cup,
      will be helpful for those who are not familiar with its
      signs. I am not suggesting the use of the "Nelros" saucer,
      for the reason that its signs are somewhat obscure, and
      students who have no experience in the science of astrology
      would find it confusing, if used in addition to the cup, in
      which all needful signs are illustrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in the case of the ordinary tea-cup, the handle remains as
      the representative of the consultant. The turning of it and
      draining of the moisture should be carried out in the usual
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately under the handle, and above the space given to
      the Sun, are seen a Diamond and a Horseshoe. Next on the left
      are a Snake twisted round a stick, and a Spade, these being
      placed over the space given to Saturn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following them are a Bell and a Club, seen over the sign of
      Venus. Next, an Eye and Envelope, above the space given to
      Jupiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then comes a Cross, with the sign of Pisces, the Fishes,
      these being over the sign of Mercury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next are a Winecup and a Spider above the space of Mars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Followed by a Cat's Head and a Heart, above the Moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each one of these signs round the brim has a symbolic
      meaning, though their meaning must also be judged by the
      position they occupy in the cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, taking the signs round the brim of the cup, and
      connecting them with the planetary symbols beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beginning at the handle is a Diamond, this being a token of
      wealth, which, with the sign of the Sun below, indicates much
      prosperity, favours, and general well-being, the Horseshoe
      over the Sun also betokening good luck and successful
      projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next space, reading to the left, is the Snake twisted
      round a stick, over the sign of Saturn. This is emblematical
      of a risk of poverty coming through deceit, and with a Spade
      over Saturn, whose characteristic is privation, there is a
      further indication of toil, loss, undoing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next sign is a happier one; the Bell over the sign of
      Venus, with the Club beyond, indicates joyful news, events
      meaning much happiness, love and peace, the characteristic of
      Venus being peace or placidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next is the sign of Jupiter, whose characteristic is
      expansion; above it are placed an Eye and an Envelope, the
      Eye showing the power of penetration, seeing things in a
      right perspective, and light thrown on difficult questions,
      the letter showing that news from all parts of the world is
      made possible by its expansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next come the Latin Cross and the watery sign Pisces, the
      Fishes. These being in connection with Mercury, whose
      characteristic is activity, show much alertness and desire
      for knowledge; the Cross meaning obstacles and hindrances in
      the chosen path, whilst the sign of Pisces denotes
      interesting news from distant lands, with much desire for
      travel and exploration.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next space the Winecup and Spider, in connection with
      the sign of Mars, the characteristic of Mars being energy,
      show the strength, courage, and perseverance needed to carry
      out a successful career; the Spider being a symbol of
      concentration, patience, and achievement, whilst the Wine-cup
      tells of joy and realised ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following these signs are the Cat's Head and the Heart, with
      the Crescent Moon below. The characteristic of the Moon is
      change, mobility; it is also a symbol of good fortune in the
      tea-leaves. In combination with the Heart it indicates a
      romantic love affair. The Cat's Head shows interference by
      those who are mean and spiteful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having learned from this brief explanation the symbols of the
      "Nelros Cup," the reading of the tea-leaves in relation to
      those symbols will be easy. For instance, suppose the wife of
      a sailor to be the consultant. Her husband is on his ship in
      the North Sea, and she is eagerly awaiting news of him. In
      the cup she has "turned," the symbol of a letter comes in the
      watery sign <b>)-(</b> with a large ivy leaf beneath it.
      Further patience will be necessary, the ivy leaf tells us, as
      the wished-for letter is still far away. The distance from
      the handle (the consultant) shows this, also the letter
      symbol being in the watery sign indicates the fact that it
      will come from across the sea. The waiting for the news
      causes a feeling of disappointment and sadness; these will
      vanish later on, and the waiting be compensated by the happy
      news that will come in the longed-for letter. This is seen by
      the tea-leaves which appear on other symbols of the cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      The form of a man is seen between the signs of the Bell and
      Club; near this form is the letter "A," the first letter of
      the consultant's name. Round this initial letter is a
      well-formed circle; a trident lies at a little distance from
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is evidence of the joyful news coming from her husband,
      the tea-leaves in the spaces of the Bell and Club making a
      prediction of the satisfactory news a safe one. The circle
      round the letter "A" and the symbol of the trident near,
      enable the seer to prophesy a good promotion, much success
      and happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This example reading of the "Nelros" cup is a fortunate one.
      We will now consider one of a less satisfactory character.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consultant is a widow; opposite the handle of the cup she
      has "turned" is the Envelope over Jupiter, upon the Envelope
      tea-leaves forming an Owl are seen, beneath is a small arrow
      pointing towards the handle. These signs foretell bad news
      probably coming from a far country; the sign of Jupiter and
      distance from the handle (the consultant) would show this.
      The symbol of the Owl indicates the anxiety caused by the
      arrival of the letter and its news. The arrow pointing
      towards the handle would show that the matter is personal,
      and will much affect the consultant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the sign of Saturn, with an arm stretched towards the
      Spade above it, is the figure of a man. The characteristic of
      Saturn being privation, and the Spade being a symbol of toil,
      it is evident that the figure of the man represents someone
      related to the consultant for whom the present prospects are
      very bad. It may well be this man from whom is coming the
      news in the letter which will cause her so much anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, on the Anchor at the bottom of the cup is a
      well-formed key. Being in this position, it shows that
      someone at a distance, having the welfare of the consultant
      much in their mind, will be the means in the future of
      helping her out of the difficulties. The key being on the
      Anchor indicates the security she may feel in the friends,
      who will be instrumental in giving her happiness and peace of
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two example divinations will illustrate the manner in
      which the tea-leaves are read in relation to the signs upon
      the cup. To some it may appear an easier means than that of
      the ordinary tea-cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case it is very useful to have an alternative method
      of foretelling the future. Variety is always acceptable, and
      for this reason I commend the "Nelros Cup of Fortune" to my
      readers.

      facts; a closed book is a sign of expectancy.

      SOME EXAMPLE CUPS WITH THEIR<br>
      INTERPRETATIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following twenty illustrations are photographs of cups
      which on various occasions have been turned by consultants
      and interpreted by a seer. The student will find these of
      much practical value in learning what symbols to look for,
      and how to discern them clearly as the cup is turned about in
      the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The divination of each cup should be carefully studied with
      its illustration; by this means the student will be enabled
      to grasp the principles upon which to form a judgment of the
      cup as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having mastered this, the knowledge gained can be
      supplemented by reference to the alphabetical Dictionary of
      Symbols and Their Meanings in the previous chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      To study the illustrations and their descriptions correctly,
      the former must be turned about and about until each symbol
      has been identified.

    <h4>
      INTERPRETATION
    </h4>
    <h5>
      FIGURE I
    </h5>
    <p>
      The most noticeable feature of this cup is the clear evidence
      given that the chief interests of the consultant are bound up
      in some man in India. That there is delay in receiving
      important news from him is shown by the symbol of the pigeon
      on the stone immediately beneath the handle. But that most
      favourable news may be expected later is certain, for the
      figure of a man upon an elephant with a pineapple beyond
      gives proof of this. The natives with the large "P" in
      conjunction show that the Punjaub is indicated, and this is
      further emphasised by the sign-post which points towards
      these symbols. The child's toys show the consultant's
      association and happiness with children. The figure of the
      woman seated on the edge of a rock with its curious peak
      behind her, and the seagull below, suggest that storms at sea
      will cause distress to some woman known to the consultant.
      The small figure "11," close to this symbol, points out that
      it is likely to be eleven days before there is hope of the
      anxiety being relieved.

      rock. Small numeral "11" above. Seagull perched on small rock
      beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>In centre</i>.&mdash;Pigeon standing on large stone, man in
      sun helmet on elephant. Sign-post pointing to letter "P."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Near rim and handle</i>.&mdash;A pineapple on dish.

    <h4>
      INTERPRETATION
    </h4>
    <h5>
      FIGURE II
    </h5>
    <p>
      This cup shows that a variety of events may be expected, with
      a fair proportion of pleasure and success to be anticipated
      from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The finger beyond the handle pointing to the ark indicates
      that in all trials the consultant will find a refuge. The
      hanging lamp is also a guarantee of coming success, and
      prosperous undertakings, in some new plan which is under
      consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clouds, the symbol of the goat beyond which is facing
      into the open gateway, signify that an advantageous
      opportunity, to which a certain amount of risk is attached,
      awaits the consultant; the prominent figurehead upon the
      stone pillar gives assurance that all will turn out well, and
      that there is no need for hesitation in embarking upon this
      new opportunity; that it will necessitate a removal is shown
      by the buildings beyond. The quill pen and dots point to the
      fact that some legal business will be transacted over money
      affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dove-cot in the centre, with the form of a widow with
      dots around, signifies that a benefit to the home may be
      expected in the future, through a widow. The clergyman in
      conjunction, holding a paper, shows that the benefit will
      probably come about through a reconciliation. The bank of
      clouds behind the ferry boat shows that some trouble, to be
      expected in the future, will be lightened by the help of good
      friends. Whilst the bird stationary upon the piece of wood,
      at some distance from the consultant, and in conjunction with
      the letter "L," means uncertainty as to some desired
      information, which should come from someone whose name begins
      with "L."

      curved wall and buildings. Small quill pen and dots.

    <p>
      <i>In centre</i>.&mdash;Dove-cot. Widow in flowing veil seated

    <h4>
      INTERPRETATION
    </h4>
    <h5>
      FIGURE III
    </h5>
    <p>
      The cat with dots around being near the handle indicates
      financial worry in the home. The bone beyond shows that the
      misfortunes will be met with courage, and eventually
      overcome. The cockatoo, with the cauliflower appearing on the
      opposite side, signifies that an unreliable friend will cause
      the consultant a little uneasiness, and as a small symbol of
      a mushroom is beside it, a quarrel with this undesirable
      friend may be expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pear may be linked to the symbol of the font in the
      centre of the cup, showing that the consultant may expect
      news of a birth; the carving indicates that the news will
      give much satisfaction; the wine-cup, with the leg in
      conjunction, points out that the ambitions of the consultant
      will certainly be realised in the future. That a certain
      amount of waiting will be necessary is shown by the distance
      from the handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The motor boat, and monument in the centre, foretell the
      successful outcome of a new venture, which at present is
      unthought-of. The rocks show that a certain amount of mental
      agitation is aroused by the setting out on this undertaking,
      but, with the reassuring symbols in this cup, no alarm is
      necessary.

    <h4>
      INTERPRETATION
    </h4>
    <h5>
      FIGURE IV
    </h5>
    <p>
      The symbol of the seal being directly under the handle, with
      the large arch and carving beyond, show that the consultant
      will soon enjoy the fulfilment of a long desired hope;
      everything is going smoothly, and will turn out as desired.
      The only obstacle is seen in the symbol of the weasel, which
      appears beyond the seal, pointing to the fact that the
      consultant has someone who is not to be trusted in the home,
      but this will not result in anything serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figures of the two women opposite the handle show the
      arrival of friends to the "house," bringing presents with
      them. The inkpot, pen, and numeral "7," with the bird's nest
      in connection, show that happy news, as the result of
      personal effort on the part of the consultant, may be looked
      for within seven days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rock, motor, and wavy lines being in conjunction, warn
      the consultant of some forthcoming vexation, and possibly
      alarm, in connection with a motor expedition, but the episode
      is in the distance, and will not be more than a passing
      cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slug, at the bottom of the cup, predicts a future
      disturbance with someone, but the matter will be trifling.
      The large symbol of the king and queen upon the throne,
      opposite the handle, foretells a future of honour and wealth,
      and the assurance of every happiness for this fortunate
      consultant.

    <h5>
      FIGURE V
    </h5>
    <p>
      The large rock on the side, with the letter "J" beside it,
      speaks of a forthcoming vexation or trouble caused by someone
      whose name begins with "J." The necklace and jewellery
      beyond, with scattered dots around, give a cheerful assurance
      to the consultant of coming prosperity. This is further
      emphasised by the circle of dots above the letter "C" in the
      centre. As the initial is large, it probably indicates the
      name of the place from which the source of wealth may be
      anticipated; and that much happiness will come to the
      consultant in the future, is shown by the dancing figure and
      carved figures being in conjunction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small basket, the sausage, and roll of bread, with the
      query and "2" beyond, all point to the fact that the
      consultant will have little complaints and grumbles to put up
      with, and there will be some doubt as to which of two people
      is most to blame. But it will be only a small ripple upon the
      otherwise smooth surface of the consultant's outlook.

      FIGURE VI
    </h5>
    <p>
      The numeral "4," beside the shapeless leaves, and the line
      leading from this to the flat rock beyond, indicate that in
      about four days the consultant may expect to meet with
      obstacles in the way of some prospective outing or pleasure,
      which will probably fall through.
    </p>
    <p>
      The corkscrew, with the letter "C" in conjunction, signifies
      vexatious curiosity as to the consultant's private concerns,
      on the part of persons whose names begin with these initials.
      But that it is merely a passing annoyance is shown by the
      symbol of the arch, and dancing figures above it, and, with
      the fig tree beyond, foretells the development of things most
      wished for, and much future happiness and prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The anvil in the centre, with the branches of a tree in
      conjunction, suggests that it will be largely owing to the
      consultant's energy that this hopeful outlook in the future
      may safely be predicted.

    <h5>
      FIGURE VII
    </h5>
    <p>
      Although the small symbol of the dagger points towards the
      consultant, it would not in this case predict a personal
      danger, as there are no further signs of illness or
      misfortune. So that it may safely be taken to mean that the
      consultant will shortly be going to see a friend who has had
      an operation; this fact is borne out by the short dotted line
      beyond, leading to the door knocker, under which is written
      the word "in."
    </p>
    <p>
      The numeral "7" coming at the end of the dotted line would
      show that it will probably be seven weeks before this friend
      recovers from the illness. This friend's name is shown to
      begin with "L," as that letter is also near the end of the
      lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more distant signs of a brooch and a cabinet beyond both
      foretell the unexpected development of good fortune. If the
      consultant is married, the thimble in the centre would show
      future changes in the household; that they will be
      advantageous is shown by the large feather which gives
      assurance of a prosperous future.
    </p>
    <p>
      That this may come about through a friend, or lover, is shown
      by the cigar, and is further emphasised by the large dots
      beside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A warning against extravagance, however, is given to the
      consultant by the crinoline, which appears amidst these signs
      of future wealth.

    <p>
      The only definite indication of future prospects is shown by
      the symbol of the organ, and acorn, upon the circle at the
      bottom of the cup, the position of these signs showing that
      hope will not be realised for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these symbols make the prediction of ultimate success a
      safe one. Should the consultant be a musician, triumph in the
      profession would be assured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coal scoop and beetle are significant of domestic worries
      and household cares. But the tea cosy in the centre promises
      compensation in the way of small comforts and affection.

      The most striking features of this cup are the various
      indications of pleasure and social enjoyment. These being
      shown by the cake and butterfly, while the orchid in
      conjunction predicts that the consultant's personal charm and
      power of attraction will result in a future of wealth and
      social distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pillar, near the rim and handle, gives a pleasing
      assurance of security and loyal friends. The bird flying from
      the cage brings joyful news, that something which has been an
      obstacle in the way of the consultant's desires is about to
      be removed, and much future happiness may be looked for.

      This cup indicates that the consultant is apt to be ruffled
      by trifles and to become upset by anything unexpected. As,
      for instance, in the case of the arrival of visitors, shown
      by the mass of leaves and chair. The query beside it shows
      the indecision of the consultant's mind as to necessary
      arrangements. The boots on the opposite side denote that lack
      of income will not trouble the consultant.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that there is some misfortune or hindrance in the future
      is shown by the symbol of the broken cross in the bottom of
      the cup; the head and shoulders of the woman beside it
      suggest that this trouble will be caused by a woman.
      Compensation will be found in the happy love affair, which is
      clearly predicted by the cherries, the figures of the man and
      woman embracing, and the man's hat and pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Large dots signify that wealth will be added to happiness.
      This event must not be expected for some months, as the
      symbols are in the bottom of the cup.

      The present conditions of this consultant are not cheering.
      The large cloud, associated with dots, the small dog on the
      opposite side, and the policeman beyond, all point to
      grievous money worries, possibly caused by dishonesty.

    <p>
      The somewhat indistinct axe implies a brave effort to
      overcome, and final mastery of, some of the difficulties.

      However, the future has more pleasant prospects, and may be
      looked forward to with hope. The symbols of the clover and

      The consultant who has "turned" this cup must be prepared for
      delays, and must not expect real happiness until rather late
      in life, this being shown by the bonnet and strings on the
      side of the cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small symbol of birds on a perch gives further evidence
      that having to wait is a feature of the consultant's lot. The
      rock and pipe beyond show some dismay with regard to a dear
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The large spray of mistletoe and holly at the bottom of the
      cup, with the letters "F" and "L" in conjunction, implies
      that some event of importance to the consultant, in
      connection with persons whose names begin with these initial
      letters, will occur in the winter. If the cup has been
      "turned" during the autumn or winter, probably a year will
      pass before the event takes place, as the mistletoe indicates
      delay. But this consultant is prepared to hear the truth, and
      faces it calmly, even if it is a little unpleasant; the
      symbol of the woman looking into the glass brings this fact
      to light.

      This cup was "turned" by a well-known authoress. Its sinister

    <p>
      The consultant who "turned" this cup was sorrowful and had
      either just passed through a bereavement, or such will take
      place in the immediate future. The rough cross and the grave
      near the handle point to this. The bed, with the figure of
      the woman in nurse's cloak near it tells of serious illness
      in the home. But this is a future trouble, as the symbols
      appear at some distance from the handle. The saucepan also
      bears witness to the general gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ivy leaves beyond the rough cross show the patience with
      which the consultant bears the trials; also that good and
      loyal friends will be a source of comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small bit of wood and the closed book are symbols of
      hope, and assure this sad consultant that the expected
      improvement in affairs will certainly take place and will
      relieve some of the present anxieties.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the most that can be foretold of the future, for
      there are no signs of pleasant events or definite changes.
      Indeed, the symbol of the loaf of bread in the centre of the
      cup shows that monotony and ordinary routine are all that can
      be predicted from the divination.

      INTERPRETATION
    </h4>
    <h5>
      FIGURE XVI
    </h5>
    <p>
      This cup gives an impression of a somewhat undeveloped
      character which is further brought into notice by the stump
      of a tree on the circle; the hen on a nest, near the handle,
      points to a home life of comfort and affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The egg in the cup, and the duck, show that a risk of
      threatened disaster, as a result of rash speculation will be
      averted, and with the symbol of the three boots, fortunate
      prospects, and the guarantee of hope fulfilled, may safely be
      predicted for the future.

    <p>
      <i>On sides</i>.&mdash;Hen on nest. Shapeless leaves. Egg in
      cup.

      INTERPRETATION
    </h4>
    <h5>
      FIGURE XVII
    </h5>
    <p>
      The figure of the child, with its toys beyond, implies that
      new plans, to be made very soon, will be most beneficial, and
      will bring much pleasure to the consultant. But as the
      sausages and snail are not far distant, there is likely to be
      a marring of the pleasant conditions, caused by an act of
      unfaithfulness on the part of someone with whom the
      consultant is closely connected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bellows beyond suggest that the matter is treated with as
      much philosophy as possible, and with a resolve to make the
      best of a bad business; the ham also, being in conjunction,
      it is evident that the episode will not interfere with the
      consultant's success in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sign post, with the running figure beside it and the
      large letter "M" beyond, prepare the consultant for startling
      news, the result of which will be of great importance. The
      news will come from a place beginning with the letter "M."
      There is no doubt that the matter will turn out admirably and
      bring about many advantages, as shown by the spreading
      branches of the tree; while the grapes beneath promise
      abundant success and joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The large boot-tree and latch-key on the circle beneath the
      handle predict a fortunate and unexpected gain in the near
      future. This consultant may look forward with confidence to
      the pleasures which fate has in store.

    </h5>
    <p>
      The shadow beneath the haycock shows that the consultant will
      soon be placed in a somewhat trying position and will have
      considerable difficulty in finding a way out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The future is full of promise and there can be little doubt
      that the consultant will enjoy the pleasures of prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A journey to a cold climate to be taken later will result in
      very propitious news as shown by the symbol of the pheasant.

      tree. Pheasant flying.

      <i>Near circle</i>.&mdash;Head of a polar bear.

    <h4>
      INTERPRETATION
    </h4>
    <h5>
      FIGURE XIX
    </h5>
    <p>
      The doll on the side, with the small symbol of a toadstool
      beside it, gives a warning to the consultant against folly
      and a bad habit of gossiping when feeling bored in society.
      The stuffed head of the deer, in this case, shows that much
      distress is caused by the unguarded talk, and the consultant
      certainly cannot be described as an "innocent cause."
    </p>
    <p>
      The various scattered shapeless leaves point to confusion,
      and a somewhat "happy-go-lucky" nature. The spray of poppies
      on the circle beneath the handle foreshows that a pleasant
      experience may be expected in the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The broken gate, with the cross above it, denotes that a new
      opportunity which awaits the consultant at a future date,
      will coincide with a time of perplexity and trouble, which
      fact is further borne out by the running figure below. This
      being in conjunction with a large letter "Y," implies that
      the disturbance will arise in connection with a place, the
      name of which begins with "Y."

    <h5>
      FIGURE XX
    </h5>
    <p>
      This cup shows confusion and that the consultant was in a
      state of mental turmoil at the time of "turning" it. But in
      spite of this drawback there are some interesting facts to be
      found.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dotted circles and large ornamental arch point to a most
      hopeful outlook and to the successful development of some
      desire at present unattainable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The various initials and small numerals scattered about show
      correspondence as to plans and fixing of dates. The bush
      apple tree speaks of some pleasure which may be looked
      forward to in the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dancing figures predict much future happiness; the
      numerous changes which are likely to come about will all tend
      to success and the gratifying of the consultant's wishes. And
      what more cheerful outlook than this can be desired?

      CONCLUDING NOTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It may be safely promised to those who follow the simple
      instructions given in this book that within a short time they
      will find themselves encircled by a halo of popularity. For
      few things provide a more certain guarantee of this pleasant
      condition than that of being able to "tell fortunes."
      Divination by tea-leaves will bring to those who study it
      deeply a fund of knowledge beyond the radius of normal
      understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those who use it as a means of amusement only, it will
      give pleasure which is dependent upon nothing more difficult
      to obtain than a cup of tea! With this recommendation I will
      leave these pages, in the sincere hope that this little book
      may be of real value to those who desire to be initiated into
      the fascinating art of reading the future in a tea-cup.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
